# World_Weather_Analysis

This project involves developing a trip advising app that allows users to specify a range of favorable temperatures to visualize and create an itinerary (by filtering out locations within the specified temperature range. In doing so, I utilized several Python Libraries, modules, and methods in addition to different APIs, each enabling me to take inputs, extract location, weather, and routes data from OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps websites, store data in  CSV format and visualize them as maps.

# Note:

For this assignment, I asked for an extension from Kyla, and she accepted that I would not lose marks if I submitted my answers before midnight Friday.
